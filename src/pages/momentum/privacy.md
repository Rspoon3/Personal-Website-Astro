# Privacy Policy

**Momentum** is designed with your privacy in mind. Your workout and health data stays on your device, and we only collect minimal information necessary to provide AI-powered feedback.

## Information We Collect

**Momentum** accesses the following data from Apple Health to provide personalized workout feedback:

- Workout data (type, duration, calories, heart rate)
- Step counts and activity data
- Weight entries
- Basic profile information (age, biological sex, height) for context

This data is processed to generate AI feedback and is not stored on external servers except when using cloud-based AI features.

## How We Use Your Data

- **Local Processing:** Most data stays on your device and is processed locally.
- **AI Feedback:** When using cloud-based AI (ChatGPT), anonymized workout summaries are sent to generate personalized messages. No personally identifiable information is included.
- **On-Device AI:** When available (iOS 26+), AI processing happens entirely on your device with no data sent externally.

## Information We Do Not Collect

The **Momentum** app does not collect or store:

- Names or email addresses
- Location data
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Any data beyond what is needed for workout feedback

## Your Data Stays Private

- All health data accessed from Apple Health remains on your device.
- AI-generated messages are stored locally.
- You can delete all app data at any time through the app settings.

## Contacting Me

By contacting me in any of the following ways you are explicitly giving details of yourself (such as your account name or email address) and giving permission for me to answer any questions or comments you may have. These messages will possibly be stored, monitored, and used in accordance with the privacy policy of the service(s) used.

## Business Transfers

If **Momentum**, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of **Momentum** may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy for Children

The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal data while contacting me, please reach out and I will take steps to remove it.
