# Privacy Policy

**Hot Takes** is designed with your privacy in mind. The app ensures that your data remains private and secure. No personal user data is collected, stored, or shared with external parties beyond what is essential for subscription management and user-submitted content.

## User-Submitted Content

**Hot Takes** allows users to submit content, including:

- Custom categories
- Custom cards
- Optional category images

This content is submitted explicitly by users and is stored to provide app functionality. We do not associate this submitted content with personal identifying information such as names, email addresses, or device identifiers.

## Information We Do Not Collect

The **Hot Takes** app does not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data, such as:

- Names
- Email addresses
- Usage analytics
- Device identifiers
- Any other identifiable data about you or your device


## Subscription Management

For managing subscriptions, **Hot Takes** uses [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com). RevenueCat processes subscription transactions securely through Apple's App Store. RevenueCat does not collect user-identifiable information beyond what is strictly necessary to manage your subscription. This includes:

- Subscription status (e.g., active or inactive)
- Product identifiers associated with your subscription tier

RevenueCat complies with all relevant privacy standards and does not sell or share your data.

## Your Data Stays on Your Device

All content, settings, and data created or used within the app are stored locally on your device. This means:

- No external servers are used for processing or storing your app data.
- Your data remains private and is inaccessible to anyone but you.

## Consent

By using the app, you consent to this privacy policy.

## Business Transfers

If **Hot Takes**, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, subscription-related data might be one of the assets transferred to the new entity. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and any acquirer of **Hot Takes** will be bound by this privacy policy.

## Privacy Policy for Children

The app does not collect, store, or share any personal information, ensuring compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal data while contacting me, please reach out, and I will take steps to remove it.

## Privacy Policy Changes

From time to time, this privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be modified accordingly.
