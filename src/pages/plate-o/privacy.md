# Privacy Policy

**Plate-O** is designed with your privacy in mind. The app ensures that your data remains private and secure. No user data is collected, stored, or shared with external parties beyond what is essential for subscription management.

## Information We Do Not Collect

The **Plate-O** app does not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data, such as:

- Names
- Email addresses
- Usage analytics
- Any other identifiable or non-identifiable data about you or your device.

## Location Data (Optional)

Plate-O allows users to optionally store their current location when creating trips or tracking license plate locations. This data is stored securely on your device and is not shared with external parties.

### Usage of Location Data

- **Trip Start and End Points**: Users can choose to save their start and end locations for trips.
- **License Plate Locations**: Users can log the location where a license plate was collected.

This location data is stored solely on your device for your reference. Plate-O does not transmit or share this data with any external service.

## Subscription Management

For managing subscriptions, **Plate-O** uses [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com). RevenueCat processes subscription transactions securely through Apple's App Store. RevenueCat does not collect user-identifiable information beyond what is strictly necessary to manage your subscription. This includes:

- Subscription status (e.g., active or inactive)
- Product identifiers associated with your subscription tier

RevenueCat complies with all relevant privacy standards and does not sell or share your data.

## Your Data Stays on Your Device

All content, settings, and data created or used within the app are stored locally on your device. This means:

- No external servers are used for processing or storing your app data.
- Your data remains private and is inaccessible to anyone but you.

## Consent

By using the app, you consent to this privacy policy.

## Business Transfers

If **Plate-O**, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, subscription-related data might be one of the assets transferred to the new entity. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and any acquirer of **Plate-O** will be bound by this privacy policy.

## Privacy Policy for Children

The app does not collect, store, or share any personal information, ensuring compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal data while contacting me, please reach out, and I will take steps to remove it.

## Privacy Policy Changes

From time to time, this privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be modified accordingly.
