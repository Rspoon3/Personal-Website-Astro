# Privacy Policy

**Prime Not Prime** is designed with your privacy in mind. No data is collected, stored, or shared with external parties. The app operates entirely on your device, ensuring your information stays private and secure.

## Information We Do Not Collect

The **Prime Not Prime** app does not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data. This includes:

- Names
- Email addresses
- Location data
- Usage analytics
- Any other identifiable or non-identifiable data about you or your device.

## Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Your Data Stays on Your Device

All content, settings, and data created or used within the app are stored locally on your device. This means:

- No external servers or third-party services are used to process or store your data.
- Your data remains private and is inaccessible to anyone but you.

## Contacting Me

By contacting me in any of the following ways you are explicitly giving details of yourself (such as your account name or email address) and giving permission for me to answer any questions or comments you may have. These messages will possibly be stored, monitored, and used in accordance with the privacy policy of the service(s) used.

## Business Transfers

If **Prime Not Prime**, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of **Prime Not Prime** may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy for Children

The app does not collect, store, or share any personal information, and therefore is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal data while contacting me, please reach and I will take steps to remove it.

## Privacy Policy Changes

From time to time, this privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be modified accordingly.
