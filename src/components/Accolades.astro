          Winner of the <a href="https://fulu.org" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline font-semibold">FULU Foundation's</a> $20,000 bounty for successfully reverse engineering and repairing Echelon fitness equipment 
          that had been locked down by a firmware update. Echelon pushed an update that forced their bikes, treadmills, and rowers 
          to connect to their servers before functioning, breaking compatibility with third-party apps like Sync Spin and QZ that users relied on. 
          This anti-consumer move prevented people from using their purchased hardware with the software of their choice. 
          My solution restored interoperability and gave users back control of their own devices, championing the right-to-repair 
          movement and consumer freedom. The bounty was offered by Louis Rossmann's FULU Foundation as part of their mission 
          to fight against companies that restrict device ownership through software locks.
