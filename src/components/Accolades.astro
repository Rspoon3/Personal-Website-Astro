          Winner of the <a href="https://fulu.org" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline font-semibold">FULU Foundation's</a> $20,000 bounty for successfully reverse engineering and repairing Echelon fitness equipment 
          that had been locked down by a firmware update. Echelon pushed an update that forced their bikes, treadmills, and rowers 
          to connect to their servers before functioning, breaking compatibility with third-party apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id16739968248" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline font-semibold">Sync Spin</a> and QZ that users relied on. 
          This anti-consumer move prevented people from using their purchased hardware with the software of their choice. 
          My solution restored interoperability and gave users back control of their own devices, championing the right-to-repair 
          movement and consumer freedom. The bounty was offered by Louis Rossmann's FULU Foundation as part of their mission 
          to fight against companies that restrict device ownership through software locks.

                Witherspoon says that, basically, Echelon added an authentication layer to its products, where the piece of exercise equipment checks to make sure that it is online and connected to Echelon’s servers before it begins to send information from the equipment to an app over Bluetooth. “There’s this precondition where the bike offers an authentication challenge before it will stream those values. It is like a true digital lock,” he said. “Once you give the bike the key, it works like it used to. I had to insert this [authentication layer] into the code of my app, and now it works.”
